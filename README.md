# Extracting-User-Journey-Data-with-SQL
This project is part of the 365 Data Science platform's "Extracting User Journey Data with SQL" case study. The goal is to preprocess customer journey data directly in SQL, creating a detailed sequence of user interactions for further analysis.

## Task Overview
The project focuses on building a comprehensive view of user journeys on a subscription-based platform. A "user journey" represents the sequence of pages a user visits before completing a purchase. This SQL-based preprocessing lays the groundwork for advanced analysis in future projects.

## SQL Implementation
The SQL queries in this repository address the following:

- Filtering test user records to ensure data integrity.
- Aggregating page visit sequences for users who completed a purchase.
- Creating a customer journey data extract for further exploration.
